A project to show the use of Big Mauji. 
The aim of this application is to provide a realistic, user friendly, cleaner and beautiful user interface for its customers. This application is inspired by Whatsapp and the functionalities are similar to Whatsapp with an emphasis made on providing a cleaner and beautiful UI and text fonts.
